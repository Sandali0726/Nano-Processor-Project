# Nano-Processor-Project
This project involves designing a 4-bit nanoprocessor capable of adding and subtracting signed integers. It includes memory, CPU, input/output, and a bus. We used multiplexers, decoders, and custom ROM instructions for subtracting and comparing register values. The project enhanced our processor design and teamwork skills.
